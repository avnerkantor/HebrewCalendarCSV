# Hebrew Calendar CSV Table
You can find here Geoergian-Hebrew Calendar table for 2000-2020 including a python script.

## Why
A few days ago I was asked to convert Georgian dates in SQL Server to to Hebrew dates. In order to do it simply I looked fot ready csv table for left join. I couldn't find one so I made one by myself.
